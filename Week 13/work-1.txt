Hierarchical Clustering
recap from last week:
2 types of hierachical Clustering. join  two clostes cluster accoridng the proximity matrix.
keep doing until only 1 cluster remains
how to define inter-cluser similairty?
4 different distances, 
min, max, Group average, Distanec btw Centroids. other methods drice y an objective functipn.
Dis bt Centroid is not geometrice, but based on the distributions
MAXX(Completed DIstance)
max distance of the cluster points
Computing the minimum of the max distance, of the cluster form. then from these merge these clusters
not max, but a min max
//
If it is about proximity, then its the max of min distance from each cluster
minmax/maxmin always merge afterwars and recalculate it
//
join two closest cluster, not much differnce. Compute distance of the cluster as the maximim distance.
distance of this new cluster is the minimum possible distancce.

Strength of MAX:
less susceptible to noise and outliers than MIN
limitations:
tends to break clusters
biased towards global clusters
Group Average:
proximity of two clusters is the aveate of pairwaise proximity bte points in two clusters.
kinda like SSE
all of these are the same distances. 2 ideas bte dis bte sets.
one is Min,
proximity of group average of the points distance from each pnt in the cluster
\\
recalculate distance of the points
