Ready Final Exams next Tuesday
Undergraduate Topics to stuffy for
//
Final Structure
sameas before 120, 100 max you can get
Grads have 5UG and 1G question
INTERMEDIATE STEPS ARE A MUST!
//
Niaves Bayes, SVM Classification
Hierachical Clustering
-HC twist: data points are binary 7 dimension vcctors
-proximity not givien
-Metrix in B7 hammin distance
HAMMING DISTANCE is allow3ed
Clustering K-Means
DBSCAN usage
G
Evalutaion of Hierachical Cluster
Compute Cophenetic Distance Table, Cophenetic Correlation
//Q1
Naive Bayes
Niave Bayes of it a column could just be a table. of feature x feature amount for class.Normal Distribution for the continous data set
SVM for 3 points, 2 class 1 and 1 and class 2. 
All three points aer support vecors. Lets sau all 3 ar not linear dependent. IF 2 points are support vectors, then that means that any plane willl have teh same orthogonal vecors. Should go through the vector.
2 Plausible vector. if they are , then the distance to equidistance has to be bigger than the support vector.If there there is onee that smaller then , there is more than 2 vector.
Assume 2 support vector, thier margin should be bigger than the equidistance . we all assume that the plane is equidistant to the tree points. Start with assume that there is 2 support points, then prove the negative true. that it can not be that there is only 2\\
use system of equation, can use y(x) = mx + b if it is a 2 dimensional data\\
//Q2
Hierarchical Clustering
Similarities and Distanecs. Hamming and cosine similiarity.. Hamming distance for boolean distance
Similarity table, join 2 closes to one. If Distance, 2 closest to 0.
Can choose Single Link or Complete link
Exam, display graph of best fit items with similarity value
Single link, Closest to 1.
of pair find maximim similary of cluster for new  table
Complete Link
join closest guy close to one, but from cluster, similarity value is the lowest similarity.
//Q3 K-Means
A picture and position of K cluster centers. Must be reasonable as to why a group a cluster as such. Stay dedicated with the starting Centroid centers.
Repeat picture a couple of times. not all of them, but a reasonable amount of steps for it.
//Q4 Density Based Clusterization
maybe draw clusters. Remember minpnts = x points, include the center. Core poitns and boundary points for the  cluster. Don't forget it. Border points< minpnts but more than 1 neighboor.
is reachable if the path is from core point to core point. Relatoin ship is not symmetric. item to core point, not corepoint to non core point.
//Q5
Cophenetic measure, wrinkle is define as distances  not similarity. Need to convert similarity to distances. why important? because the value of correlation will be different when calculatiod.
Convert these valesu into a vector. and calculate correlation of vectors. dot product devided of the productof the norms. T * CT /(||T|| ||CT||)
