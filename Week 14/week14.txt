Dendrogram Computation
Ceontroid Distance
Compute the ceontroid of the cluster. then find the distance of each centroid to each other
//
dist(Ci,Cj) = dist(ci,cj)
//
Problematic property ; non-monotonic:
the proxity of the current step could be bigger than the proxity of either.
The new centroid distance, by hierachical tree, needs to bigger than the similairty of the new cluster. Non-monotonic
//
a differnt order because there is a shorter distance. distance of centroid is not usually use or reliable enough
//
new center will be the mean of the new cluster for Centroid Dendrogram
//
need to recompute all the distances. new Distance matrix
//
Centroid Dendogram is a bigger computational task
//
new stuff, not in Exam still fun
Alternatice Clustering methods
--Ward Measure--
Similarty of two cluster based on the increase in suqared error when two clusters are merged
- simialr to group average if distance bte are squared
It analyzes the variance of clusters of clusters. most suitable method for quantitative variables.
Joine cluster that have the smalles jump in SSE. Effective and most logical metric based clustering.
//
Benefits, Less susceptible to noise and outliers
Drawback, biased towards globular clusters.Similar problem with Centroid, the mergeing and jump might be more optimal in another paor
//
Its non monotonic, even though its logical way to do it.
//
Ward is extensivbly used
//
Basic use of hierarchial, to finding true num of clusters. Phylogenetic trees us hierarchical clusters. Much smoother than centroid. Ward tells more about information
//
if occurs, have to look at reason as to why it occurs. needs to be look substancly
//
Math is imprtant when eucleadian distance is needed. translate them int some other measurement or higher or same dimensional space
