recap from last week:
2 types of hierachical Clustering. join  two clostes cluster accoridng the proximity matrix.
keep doing until only 1 cluster remains
how to define inter-cluser similairty?
4 different distances, 
min, max, Group average, Distanec btw Centroids. other methods drice y an objective functipn.
Dis bt Centroid is not geometrice, but based on the distributions
MAXX(Completed DIstance)
max distance of the cluster points
Computing the minimum of the max distance, of the cluster form. then from these merge these clusters
not max, but a min max
