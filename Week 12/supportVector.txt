Support Vecor Recap
seperating with a hyperplane, some will always mislcassified, have a margin in which it can be use to
A margin is the minium distance from the seperating hyperplane
want to solve minimization of the d*
w *x + b = 0 is a plane equation
d =  x projection onto w hyperplane times y
if we normalize, then
d* = above time S
asume that multpling will make it all to one
so
y_i(wx_i + b)>= 1
d* * ||w|| = 1
min d* = 1/ ||w||
want minimuze distance of the margin of the hyperplane so
it becomes min d* = 2/||w||
rest is solving the system of inqualities
its an optimization problem
/////
look into how the kernel are constructed
/////
gamma is the actual geometric distance achieved
///
What is the cost of SVM
cost beauseof Soft margin of the SVM
recall, y(w*x+b) + e >=1 where e is the error
need to minimize the error and minimize the cost as well
///
If there is a minimum margin, there is a chance of points being in the margin or on the other side. that is the cost
///
train model with best parametsr found from tuning the training data set
seen trees, random tress, linear classifier, percetron Fishers LDA and SVM
All linear classifiers
///
we were optimizing exirimental risk and was supervizing data.
New situation, no training  set, data just comes in.
Unkown how many classes there is
Cluster analysis
//
Introduction of Clustering Amalysis
what is it?
finding groups of objects such that obj in a group could be similar to another one. diffrom from obj of other groups
intra cluster dis are minimized
inter cluster dis are maximized
//
similar if S =1 and dissimilar if S = 0
neet partition set into an uknown number of groups
measure of dis is minkowksi dis, euclidean and manhattan
cosine similarity is a dot produt of instance x and y devided by product of their magnitude
Data set has boolean features
use hamming distance or jaccard similarity
///
Cluser Analysis as learning
can also use probability to dtermine cluster/
///
But how can a Computer see a cluster?
might be spot, but can be arbitraty
Must choose a minimization to find
////
Types of clustering
///
2 main Model, Partitional and hierarchical
Partitional Clustering
Group items that are closest to each other
Hierarchical Clustering
Points belong to a subset that belong another bigger subest, etc etc
two sub types traditional  and Non traditional
